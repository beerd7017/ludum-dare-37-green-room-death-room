# Welcome to the LD 37 -Green Room Death Room repository!

## Purpose
This repository is for my attempt at Ludum Dare 37 game jam. The theme for this game jam was "One Room". My idea for the game was that the player controls the environment and creates natural disaster for the metorologists who are trapped in a greenroom while broadcasting the news.

Ultimately, this project went unfinshed because of sickness durning the weekend of the game jam.

## Rules of the Repository
* Master branch is production, period.
* Do not commit to master, please work off the development branch.
* When working locally, try to work in feature branches.
* Please follow GitFlow.
* You may fork this repository freely, for personal or commerical use. It would be cool if you dropped my name in some credits, but it's not required.
